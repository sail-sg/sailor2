This repository contains the code for Sailor2, a powerful and inclusive open language models for South-East Asia.

Sailor2 is a collaborative project partnered with Sea AI Lab, SCB10X, WiseSight, HuggingFace and the Sailor2 Community.

Sailor2 is a community-driven initiative that brings cutting-edge multilingual language models to South-East Asia (SEA). 
Our research highlights a strong demand for models in the **8B and 20B parameter** range for production use, alongside **1B models** for specialized applications, 
such as speculative decoding and research purposes. 
These models, released under the **Apache 2.0 license**, provide enhanced accessibility to advanced language technologies across the region.


Sailor2 builds upon the foundation of the awesome multilingual model [Qwen 2.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e) and 
is continuously pre-trained on **500B tokens** to support **15 languages** better with a unified model. 
These languages include English, Chinese, Burmese, Cebuano, Ilocano, Indonesian, Javanese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Sundanese, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, and Waray. 
By addressing the growing demand for diverse, robust, and accessible language models, 
Sailor2 seeks to serve the underserved in SEA areas with open, inclusive, and accessible multilingual LLMs.

## Requirements
The code of Sailor2 has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to install `transformers==4.46.3`.

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
device = "cuda"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    'sail/Sailor2-20B-Chat',
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('sail/Sailor2-20B-Chat')
system_prompt= \
'You are an AI assistant named Sailor2, created by Sea AI Lab. \
As an AI assistant, you can answer questions in English, Chinese, and Southeast Asian languages \
such as Burmese, Cebuano, Ilocano, Indonesian, Javanese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Sundanese, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, and Waray. \
Your responses should be friendly, unbiased, informative, detailed, and faithful.'

prompt = "Beri saya pengenalan singkat tentang model bahasa besar."
# prompt = "H√£y cho t√¥i m·ªôt gi·ªõi thi·ªáu ng·∫Øn g·ªçn v·ªÅ m√¥ h√¨nh ng√¥n ng·ªØ l·ªõn."
# prompt = "‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≥‡∏™‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô ‡πÜ ‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÇ‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏•‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏ç‡πà"

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)
input_ids = model_inputs.input_ids.to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=512,
)

generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```
